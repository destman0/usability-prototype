* The position of the search field in the top left corner / top navigation bar leads to easier navigation compared to having the search field within the main context of the view. - DONE

* It is easier for a user to reach an item (mail from a specific date / contact / note) with dynamic loading than via pagination.

* The use of excerpts for tables gives better overview of the content than just displaying title. - DONE

* In the navigation bar, the order: “email”,”contacts”, “calendar”
makes more sense compared to other permutations of the order. - DONE

4. Rename “Outbox” to send
5. Every user action, related to the operations with emails and contacts should be accompanied with a notification. “The email has been sent successfully”. “A new contact has been successfully created”.

9. When the user is composing a new email, he should be able to add different recipients, CC, BCC, etc.
10. User should be able to easily differentiate between Send / Save Draft / Discard buttons in a new email window. Thus the correct order for the buttons should be used (Send should go before Save, as you can clearly see the expert being confused in the video), as well as some color distinction.
